# Creating Fullstack Learning Management System(LMS)
 - Application has three major layer
  1. DataBase Layer
  2. Backend Layer
  3. Frontend Layer

# In Database Layer
 - We make two database model
   1.User Model
   2.Course Model

# In Backend Layer
 - we configure the backend layer with files & folder setup
  1. Creating a server with express
  2. Then create a testing route and listen the backend server with some PORT number
  3. Then connect server with database
  4. Creating different routes of application
  5. Creating two controller :-
        1. User Controller
        2. Course Controller
  6. After creating Controller of user level
        1. user/register
        2. user/login
        3. user/logout
        4. user/profile
        5. user/change-password
        6. user/edit-profile
  7. After user controller we create course controller
        1. course/
        2. course/:id
          (That two routes make contains serveral controllers)

# In Frontend Layer
